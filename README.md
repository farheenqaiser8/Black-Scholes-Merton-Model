# Black-Scholes-Merton-Model
In a The Black-Scholes-Merton model project, we calculates the theoretical price of options using factors like the underlying asset's price, strike price, time to expiration, volatility, and risk-free interest rate. It provides a formula for determining fair value and helps in assessing and managing options risk.
